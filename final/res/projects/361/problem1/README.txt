Professor Morris,

This program starts by 3 cracks being made in main. There is a small chance that all three objects could terminate straight at start or only get on line. The chance is very small. However if this in fact does happen run the program again.

I have included one screenshoot of a sample output I have had on my machine.You should note that I implemented the 250 crack segment limit.
