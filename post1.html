		<h1> Passing The OCA </h1>
		<p> Oracle Certified Associate</p>
		<h3> Where to begin? </h3>
		<p> First and foremost, it's important that you have a basic
			understanding of Java and programming in general. I would recomend getting a certification guide book to test every one of the test topics.

		<h3> Studying </h3>
	 		<p> A majority of the test questions were involving the Java API, 
	 			such as ArrayList and Dates, arrays, Inheritance and accesors. 
	 			I would recommend that while you are studying to write the code and try to come up with possible ways to use. 
	 		</p> 
	 		<p> Brush up on how to use Lamdas (they aren't too complicated) and on how abstract classes, 
	 			interfaces work! And make sure to buy a book with just test questions and work them out!
